# Introduction

The scECODA package provides functions for *s*ingle-*c*ell *E*xploratory
*CO*mpositional *D*ata *A*nalysis at the population-scale. It enables users to
explore their dataset by visualizing the sample structure and how groups of
samples relate to each other by providing numerous convenient plotting and
clustering functions. Additionally, it provides metrics to quantify how strongly
groups of samples separate and which cell types are driving this separation
(differential abundance analysis).

```{r}
library(scECODA)
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Create ECODA objects

You can create an ECODA object from a single-cell data (Seurat or
SingleCellExperiment object).

Alternatively, you can create an ECODA object from a data frame containing cell
counts or frequencies (in % per sample).

Based on the input, the following data and transformations will be automatically
calculated:

-   Cell counts per sample ("counts")
-   Relative abundance in % ("freq")
-   Centered log-ratio (CLR) transformed abundance ("clr")
-   Arc-sine square root transformed abundance ("asin_sqrt")
-   Optionally: you can get the pseudobulk gene expression per sample,
    normalized with DESeq2 ("pb")
-   Metadata

Additionally, it will calculate useful metrics, such as:

-   The variance of each cell type across all samples (in CLR value) in a data
    frame. It also contains their average abundance (in CLR) and cumulative
    variance explained.
-   The top *n* most highly variable cell types (HVCs) ("top_n_hvcs"). The
    number of HVCs (*n*) is automatically determined by selecting the most
    highly variable cell types explaining approximately 50% of the total
    variance (sum of variances of all cell types). Alternatively, the user can
    choose the number of cell types *n* or a variance explained threshold.
-   The names of the top *n* most highly variable cell types (HVCs) ("hvcs")
-   The variance explained by the top_n_hvcs ("variance_explained")
-   Sample distance matrix ("sample_distances")
-   

**NOTE:** To calculate CLR-transformed cell type abundances, zero counts or
relative abundances are not allowed (log of zero is not defined). For this
reason, zeros are imputed by adding a pseudocount of +1 to all samples (to not
distort ratios) or the smallest value in case the ECODA object was created from
a data frame of relative abundances.

## From Seurat object

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Loading an example Seurat dataset
library(Seurat)
library(SeuratData)
# InstallData("pbmc3k")
data("pbmc3k")
seurat_object <- UpdateSeuratObject(pbmc3k)
```

The cells of this example dataset are annotated but not assigned to samples or
biological conditions. Let us artificially assign them by creating a sample and
condition column in the metadata.

```{r}
n_samples <- 40
n_groups <- 2

seurat_object$sample_id <- ""
seurat_object$sample_id <- rep(x = paste0("sample", seq(n_samples)), length.out = length(seurat_object$sample_id))
seurat_object$condition_id <- ""
seurat_object$condition_id <- c(rep("condition1", n_samples/n_groups),
                      rep("condition2", n_samples/n_groups))
```

```{r}
# Create ECODA object
ecoda_object <- create_ecoda_object(
  seurat_object,
  sample_col = "sample_id",
  celltype_col = "seurat_annotations",
  get_pb = TRUE
)
```

## From SingleCellExperiment object

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Loading an example SingleCellExperiment dataset
library(scRNAseq)

all.ds <- surveyDatasets()
ds <- 1
sce_object <- fetchDataset(all.ds@listData[["name"]][ds], all.ds@listData[["version"]][ds])

names(sce_object@colData)
```

```{r}
library(scECODA)

# Create ECODA object
ecoda_object <- create_ecoda_object(
  sce_object,
  sample_col = "sample",
  celltype_col = "cluster",
  get_pb = TRUE
)
```

## From counts or frequency data frame

Metadata can be added optionally.

Here, we load the immune cell composition in samples from a breast cancer cohort [@zhang2021]

**NOTES:**

-   If you create an ECODA object from a data frame containg relative abundances
    (in %), please use percentage values (e.g. 30 for 30%) and not as decimals
    (NOT 0.3 for 30%).
-   If you do add metadata, **it is important to make sure that the
    counts/frequency and the metadata data frames have the same row names**.

```{r}
# Load example datasets
data(example_data)

Zhang <- example_data$Zhang
counts <- Zhang$cell_counts_lowresolution
freq <- calc_freq(counts)
metadata <- Zhang$metadata

ecoda_object <- create_ecoda_object_helper(
  counts = counts,
  metadata = metadata
)

ecoda_object <- create_ecoda_object_helper(
  freq = freq,
  metadata = metadata
)
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Visualization and quantification of sample separation

## PCA

To explore a dataset, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is commonly performed
as a first step. It is very useful to find the major axis of variation between
samples.

How strongly samples separate based on a user defined grouping can be quantified
with different metrics, for example:

-   Analysis of similarities (ANOSIM)
-   Adjusted rand index (ARI)
-   Modularity score
-   Silhouette score (not recommended as it expects gaussian cluster shapes and
    is not robust to outliers. ANOSIM and modularity are more robust.)

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ecoda_object <- create_ecoda_object_helper(
  counts = example_data$Zhang$cell_counts_lowresolution,
  metadata = example_data$Zhang$metadata
)

plot_pca(
  ecoda_object,
  label_col = "Tissue",
  title = "PCA based on cell type composition",
  n_ct_show = 5
)

# Using only the most highly variable cell types
plot_pca(
  ecoda_object,
  label_col = "Tissue",
  use_only_hvcs = TRUE,
  title = "PCA based on highly variable cell types",
  n_ct_show = 5
)


# You can get the scores like this:
feat_mat <- ecoda_object@clr
labels <- ecoda_object@metadata$Tissue

anosim_r_score <- calc_anosim(feat_mat, labels)
ari_score <- calc_ari(feat_mat, labels)
modularity_score <- calc_modularity(feat_mat, labels)
silhouette_score <- calc_sil(feat_mat, labels)

print(paste("ANOSIM R:", anosim_r_score))
print(paste("ARI:", ari_score))
print(paste("Modularity:", modularity_score))
print(paste("Silhouette:", silhouette_score))
```

### PCA (3D)

Sometimes, looking at only the first two PCA dimensions can be misleading if
there are other main sources of variance. For this purpose, we can also plot the
PCA in 3D.

```{r}
plot_pca(
  ecoda_object,
  label_col = "Tissue",
  plotly_3d = TRUE
)
```

## Box and bar plots

Box plots are another useful tool to visualize the distribution of cell types
across samples or differences in cell type composition between samples. This
function also allows you do some basic statistical comparisons in cell type
composition between groups.

**NOTE:** It is highly recommended to only do statistical testing on
log-ratio-transformed compositional data and not on counts or relative
abundances in % [@greenacre2021].

The main focus of scECODA is **exploratory** (unsupervised) analysis of samples
based on cell type composition. If you want to do down-stream comparative
(supervised) differential abundance testing of *a priori known groups*
(including statistical designs with multiple known covariates), there are other
tools available for that purpose, e.g. scCODA [@bÃ¼ttner2021] or tascCODA
[@tasccoda].

```{r}
plot_boxplot(ecoda_object, title = "CLR Abundance by Cell Type")
plot_boxplot(
  ecoda_object,
  label_col = "Tissue",
  title = "CLR Abundance by Cell Type (with Wilcoxon Test)"
)
```

This can also be plotted as stacked bar plots but it is a bit harder to read.

```{r}
# Plotting average cell type abundance by experimental group
plot_barplot(
  ecoda_object,
  label_col = "Tissue",
  plot_by = "group",
  title = "Mean Relative Abundance by Condition"
)

# Plotting cell type abundance for each sample separately
plot_barplot(
  ecoda_object,
  label_col = "Tissue",
  plot_by = "sample",
  title = "Relative Abundance for Each Sample"
)
```

## Heatmap

The clustered heatmap plot is a good alternative to not only visualize how
samples and cell types correlate but also to cluster samples. It is important
not to re-scale in order to avoid amplifying tiny differences.

It is especially useful, if you have many cell types and subtypes annotated. Box
or bar plots can get too crowded in such cases. Heatmaps are better suited to
visualize large number of samples and cell types.

Also, it is possible that you see your samples forming separate clusters in the
PCA or heatmap even though you do not find any (or only few) significant
differences in cell type composition. However, there might be small differences
among a large number of cell types which, taken all together, can still drive
sample separation and explain differences between your biological groups.

NOTE: you can specify multiple metadata columns in "label_col" to visualize how
samples group across multiple covariates simultaneously.

Here is an example for a simple dataset:

```{r}
plot_heatmap(ecoda_object, label_col = c("Clinical.efficacy.", "Tissue"))

plot_heatmap(
  ecoda_object,
  label_col = c("Clinical.efficacy.", "Tissue"),
  # Additional arguments for pheatmap:
  cutree_rows = 3,
  cutree_cols = 3
)
```

And here an example of a large healthy cohort with 868 samples and 69 cell types [@gong2024]:

```{r fig.height=16, fig.width=12}
ecoda_object <- create_ecoda_object_helper(
  counts = example_data$GongSharma_full$cell_counts_highresolution,
  metadata = example_data$GongSharma_full$metadata
)

plot_heatmap(
  ecoda_object,
  label_col = c("subject.cmv", "age_group"),
  # Additional arguments for pheatmap:
  cutree_rows = 3,
  cutree_cols = 5,
  show_colnames = FALSE
)
```

Subsetting to only the most highly variable cell types (HVCs) yields a very
similar sample clustering, while being much more interpretable.

```{r}
plot_heatmap(
  ecoda_object,
  use_only_hvcs = TRUE,
  label_col = c("subject.cmv", "age_group"),
  # Additional arguments for pheatmap:
  cutree_rows = 3,
  cutree_cols = 4,
  show_colnames = FALSE
)
```

## Cell type correlation

The cell type correlation plot offers the possibility to visualize which cell
types correlate with each other, highlighting possible microenvironment hubs
that might be of relevance to explain possible groups of samples in your data:

```{r fig.height=16, fig.width=16}
plot_corr(ecoda_object)
```

While the correlation plot below showing only the HVCs is easier to read, it is
nevertheless interesting to see the full correlation plot above. It seems that
there is additional information that might be overlooked:

Besides the main cell type clusters of effector memory cells (separating samples
by cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection status) and SOX4+ naive T cells (separating
samples by age), there seems to be a cluster of ISG+ cell types, memory T cells
and monocytes/DCs whose abundance strongly correlate, respectively.

```{r fig.height=16, fig.width=16}
plot_corr(ecoda_object, use_only_hvcs = TRUE)
```

## Highly variable cell types

As demonstrated in the heatmap of the extensive Gong & Sharma dataset, not all
69 cell subtypes contribute equally to sample separation.

Cell types at the top exhibit **high variance** across samples, indicating they
are the main drivers of group separation, while those toward the bottom show
minor variation.

This principle is directly analogous to the selection of highly variable genes
(HVGs) in (sc)RNA-seq data: **high variance is a powerful proxy for biological
relevance.**

We expect cell types that are differentially abundant between key biological
groups to display this increased variance. scECODA provides convenient functions
to calculate and visualize these cell type variances and mean abundance across
all samples:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
plot_varmean(ecoda_object, label_points = T) +
  ggtitle("Default - cell types explaining 50% variance")

plot_varmean(ecoda_object) +
  ggtitle("Default - cell types explaining 50% variance")

ecoda_object_new <- find_hvcs(ecoda_object, variance_explained = 0.8)
plot_varmean(ecoda_object_new) + ggtitle("Cell types explaining 80% variance")
ecoda_object_new <- find_hvcs(ecoda_object, top_n_hvcs = 5)
plot_varmean(ecoda_object_new) + ggtitle("Top 5 HVCs")
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ECODA vs pseudobulk

In this example, you will see how a dataset without sample separation looks like
and how it compares to a dataset with differentially abundant cell types.

Also, it will give you a feeling about the sensitivity of cell type composition
based sample separation versus pseudobulk based sample separation.

## Pseudobulk analysis

scECODA provides a convenient function to calculate and visualize sample
pseudobulks from scRNA-seq data, e.g. from a Seurat object.

In this example you will see:

1.  How to calculate pseudobulks
2.  How to plot a PCA from pseudobulks
3.  How pseudobulk compares to cell type compositional analysis
    -   When pseudobulk and cell type composition perform similarly
    -   Pseudobulk falls short of detecting differences between samples if the
        differences are in very low abundant cell types

### When pseudobulk and cell type composition perform similarly

We use the Seurat pbmc3k dataset from above (see section [From Seurat object]).

As we randomly assigned cells and samples to two arbitrary "conditions", we see
no separation between samples. All separation metrics show low scores around
zero, indicating indeed a random distribution of our samples between conditions.

```{r}
# Create ECODA object
ecoda_object <- create_ecoda_object(
  seurat_object,
  sample_col = "sample_id",
  celltype_col = "seurat_annotations",
  get_pb = TRUE
)

# # Internally this is calculated with this function:
# pb <- calculate_pseudobulk(
#   count_matrix = data[["RNA"]]$counts,
#   sample_ids = cell_data_df[[sample_col]]
# )

plot_pca(
  ecoda_object,
  label_col = "condition_id",
  title = "PCA - Cell type composition"
)
plot_pca(
  ecoda_object,
  slot = "pb",
  label_col = "condition_id",
  title = "PCA - Pseudobulk"
)
```

Observe what happens if you introduce a differential abundance of CD8 T and NK
cells between the two groups.

```{r}
# Multiply CD8 T cells and NK cells within "condition2" by 5:
seurat_object_DiffAbu <- seurat_multiply_cells_in_condition(
  seurat_object = seurat_object,
  condition_column = "condition_id",
  target_condition = "condition2",
  celltype_column = "seurat_annotations",
  target_celltypes = c("CD8 T", "NK"),
  multiplier = 5
)

# Verification (Optional):
# Check the cell counts before:
table(seurat_object@meta.data$condition, seurat_object@meta.data$seurat_annotation)
# Check the cell counts after:
table(seurat_object_DiffAbu@meta.data$condition, seurat_object_DiffAbu@meta.data$seurat_annotations)
```

All separation metrics increased and are now close to their maximum value of 1,
indicating separation of the two groups of samples.

```{r}
ecoda_object_DiffAbu <- create_ecoda_object(
  seurat_object_DiffAbu,
  sample_col = "sample_id",
  celltype_col = "seurat_annotations",
  get_pb = TRUE
)
plot_pca(ecoda_object_DiffAbu, label_col = "condition_id", title = "PCA cell type composition", n_ct_show = 2)
plot_pca(ecoda_object_DiffAbu, slot = "pb", label_col = "condition_id", title = "PCA pseudobulk")
```

It can be seen that CD8 T and NK cells are significantly higher in the
condition2. Interestingly, it can also be seen that all the other cell types
seem to be lower abundant, even though their counts were not changed. However,
their relative abundance decreased. Remember that parts of a composition are not
independent but all are part of a total. If you change one part (e.g. relatively
increase), all others change too (e.g. relatively decrease).

```{r}
plot_boxplot(ecoda_object, label_col = "condition_id", title = "CLR Abundance by Cell Type (with Wilcoxon Test)")
plot_boxplot(ecoda_object_DiffAbu, label_col = "condition_id", title = "CLR Abundance by Cell Type (with Wilcoxon Test)")
```

This can also be plotted as stacked bar plots but it is harder to read.

```{r}
# 1. Plotting Summary by condition_id (your original plot)
plot_barplot(ecoda_object, label_col = "condition_id", plot_by = "group", title = "Mean Relative Abundance by Condition")
plot_barplot(ecoda_object_DiffAbu, label_col = "condition_id", plot_by = "group", title = "Mean Relative Abundance by Condition")

# 2. Plotting Each Sample Separately (the new request)
plot_barplot(ecoda_object, label_col = "condition_id",plot_by = "sample", title = "Relative Abundance for Each Sample")
plot_barplot(ecoda_object_DiffAbu, label_col = "condition_id",plot_by = "sample", title = "Relative Abundance for Each Sample")
```

Before you introduced an artificial differential abundance, there was no major
correlation between any of the cell types. Afterwards, however, it can be
clearly seen that CD8 T and NK cells strongly correlate.

```{r}
plot_corr(ecoda_object)
plot_corr(ecoda_object_DiffAbu)
```

### ECODA outperforms pseudobulk in detecting changes in low abundant cell subtypes

Pseudobulk falls short of detecting differences between samples if the
differences are in very low abundant cell types

To showcase this effect we can again use our semi-synthetic dataset:

First, we make the Seurat object so that it has a lot more cells. For this
purpose, we multiply the cells in all samples (both conditions) by 10. Next,

```{r}
all_celltypes <- colnames(ecoda_object@counts)
low_abundant_celltypes <- c("FCGR3A+ Mono", "B")
high_abundant_celltypes <- all_celltypes[!all_celltypes %in% low_abundant_celltypes]

# Let's remove the platelets and DCs as they are zero in about half the samples
# They would introduce noise which would be further amplified when multiplying
seurat_object_clean <- seurat_object
seurat_object_clean$seurat_annotations[seurat_object_clean$seurat_annotations %in% c("Platelet", "DC")] <- NA

# We multiply most cell types by 10 in both conditions:
seurat_object_DiffAbu <- seurat_multiply_cells_in_condition(
  seurat_object = seurat_object_clean,
  condition_column = "condition_id",
  target_condition = "condition1",
  celltype_column = "seurat_annotations",
  target_celltypes = high_abundant_celltypes,
  multiplier = 10
)
seurat_object_DiffAbu <- seurat_multiply_cells_in_condition(
  seurat_object = seurat_object_DiffAbu,
  condition_column = "condition_id",
  target_condition = "condition2",
  celltype_column = "seurat_annotations",
  target_celltypes = high_abundant_celltypes,
  multiplier = 10
)

# Next, we introduce a differential abundance in the low abundant cell types
seurat_object_DiffAbu <- seurat_multiply_cells_in_condition(
  seurat_object = seurat_object_DiffAbu,
  condition_column = "condition_id",
  target_condition = "condition2",
  celltype_column = "seurat_annotations",
  target_celltypes = low_abundant_celltypes,
  multiplier = 5
)


# Verification (Optional):
# Check the cell counts before:
table(seurat_object@meta.data$condition, seurat_object@meta.data$seurat_annotation)
# Check the cell counts after:
table(seurat_object_DiffAbu@meta.data$condition, seurat_object_DiffAbu@meta.data$seurat_annotations)
```

While cell type composition is very sensitive to pick up differential abundances
even in low abundant cell types, pseudobulk gene expression completely fails to
pick up gene expressional differences in low abundant cell types:

```{r}
ecoda_object_DiffAbu <- create_ecoda_object(
  seurat_object_DiffAbu,
  sample_col = "sample_id",
  celltype_col = "seurat_annotations",
  get_pb = TRUE
)
plot_pca(ecoda_object_DiffAbu, label_col = "condition_id", title = "PCA cell type composition", n_ct_show = 4)
plot_pca(ecoda_object_DiffAbu, slot = "pb", label_col = "condition_id", title = "PCA pseudobulk")
```
